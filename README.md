Companies want to know the same thing: "How do I increase sales in order to grow my company?" With the age of machine learning and data analytics upon us, owners need not look too far to find the answers. In this data analysis of items sold by a several companies, you will see a model that can best predict the way to increase sales for any company using common metrics.

To prepare this data, the data was cleaned adn the following processes were performed:

Exploratory Data:


*   During the exploratory data analysis, a boxplot and histogram was visualized for each numeric datatype column.
*   Also, a barplot and heat map were created to find any useful insights into the data features and how they correlate.
* This gave good insight as to which features have more influence over sales than others.
